# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software/Algorithm Engineer, and an independent Researcher.

My interests including:

* DSP
* MIR
* Deep Learning/Machine Learning
* Binaural Audio
* Speech Signal Processing
* Other audio related stuff

I'm also an active user of Deep Learning framework [PyTorch].
Some projects I developed and maintained:

- [torch_specinv](https://spectrogram-inversion.readthedocs.io/): a collections of spectrogram inversion algorithms.
- [torchnmf](https://pytorch-nmf.readthedocs.io/): a package that can help building complex NMF models.
- [constant-memory-waveglow](https://zenodo.org/record/4353123): training waveglow with constant memory cost.

See [my website](https://yoyololicon.github.io/) for more details.

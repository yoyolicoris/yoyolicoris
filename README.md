# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software/algorithm engineer, independent researcher, and a first-year PhD student in the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in Artificial Intelligence and Music ([AIM](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/)) program at C4DM, Queen Mary University of London.

My interests including:

* DSP
* MIR
* Deep Learning/Machine Learning
* Binaural Audio
* Speech Signal Processing
* Other audio-related stuff

I'm also an active user of the Deep Learning framework [PyTorch].
Some projects I developed and maintained:

- [torch_specinv](https://spectrogram-inversion.readthedocs.io/): a collections of spectrogram inversion algorithms.
- [torchnmf](https://pytorch-nmf.readthedocs.io/): a package that can help building complex NMF models.
- [constant-memory-waveglow](https://zenodo.org/record/4353123): training waveglow with constant memory cost.
- [kazane](https://pypi.org/project/kazane/): simple sinc interpolation for 1D signal in PyTorch.
- [torch-fftconv](https://pypi.org/project/torch-fftconv/): FFT-based PyTorch convolution operators.

See [my website](https://yoyololicon.github.io/) for more details.
